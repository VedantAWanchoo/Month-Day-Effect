There are two codes, (i) Month Effect, (ii) Day Effect

Day Effect:

Q: Over long periods of time, do markets perform significantly better / worse on some days of the week?

A: The return on a particular day of the week is not statistically different from any other day of the week.

A: This doesn't mean that the returns are the same on avg. on every day, they are just not stastically different.


Month Effect:

Q: Do markets perform significantly better / worse during some months?

Q: Do markets perform poorly in Dec (as traders are on holiday)? So does it makes sense to buy in Dec and sell in Jan?

A: The returns of the following months are significantly different from each other: (Out of 66 possible permutations)

A: Jan-Feb, Jan-Apr, Jan-May, Jan-Jun, Jan-Nov

A: While the Dec-Jan effect is popular, the difference of returns during these two months is not statistically significant.

A: Additioanlly, it is not that Dec is a bad month for the markets, its just that Jan is the best month for the markets so buying in Dec and selling in Jan can be somewhat profitable.
